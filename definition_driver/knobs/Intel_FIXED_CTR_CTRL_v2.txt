Intel_FIXED_CTR_CTRL
//#description
Fixed-Function Performance Counter Control (R/W) Counter increments while the results of ANDing respective enable bit in IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL with the corresponding OS or USR bits in this MSR is true. [0/4/8] EN{0/1/2}_OS: Enable Fixed Counter 0/1/2 to count while CPL = 0. [1/5/9] EN{0/1/2}_Usr: Enable Fixed Counter 0/1/2 to count while CPL > 0. [2/6/10] AnyThread: When set to 1, it enables counting the associated event conditions occurring across all logical processors sharing a processor core. When set to 0, the counter only increments the associated event conditions occurring in the logical processor which programmed the MSR. [3/7/11] EN{0/1/2}_PMI: Enable PMI when fixed counter 0/1/2 overflows.
